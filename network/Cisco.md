## DHCP & DHCP snooping

This section contains common commands and recommendations for DHCP configuration on Cisco devices, DHCP helper (relay) and DHCP snooping.

### DHCP client on a router/interface

Use this when the router itself should obtain an IP via DHCP (for example on a WAN link or a lab server acting as a DHCP client):

```sh
configure terminal
    interface Fa0/0
        ip address dhcp
        no shutdown
    exit
exit
```

### DHCP helper (relay)

When you have a DHCP server on a different subnet, configure the gateway/interface that receives DHCP broadcasts to forward them to the DHCP server:

```sh
configure terminal
    interface Fa0/0
        ip helper-address <dhcp_server_ip>
    exit
exit
```

Notes:
- `ip helper-address` forwards several UDP services by default (including DHCP). If you need to restrict which services are forwarded, use `ip forward-protocol` or ACLs as appropriate.

### DHCP snooping (protects against rogue DHCP servers)

DHCP snooping filters untrusted DHCP messages and builds a binding table of MAC/IP/port information that can be used by other features (e.g., dynamic ARP inspection).

Basic configuration:

```sh
configure terminal
    # Enable DHCP snooping globally
    ip dhcp snooping

    # Enable on specific VLAN(s)
    ip dhcp snooping vlan 1

    # Interface that connects to your DHCP server (or trusted uplink) should be trusted
    interface Fa0/0
        ip dhcp snooping trust
    exit

    # Client-facing interfaces should remain untrusted (this is the default)
    # Do NOT configure 'ip dhcp snooping trust' on access ports that go to clients.
exit
```

Key points:
- Only configure `ip dhcp snooping trust` on ports that lead to DHCP servers or to another switch/router where a DHCP server resides (uplinks).
- Do not mark client-facing ports as trusted — they should remain untrusted so the switch can drop spoofed DHCP offers.
- Optionally configure a persistent database (platform-dependent) to retain bindings across reloads (e.g., `ip dhcp snooping database flash:dhcp_snoop.db`).

Verification commands:

```sh
show ip dhcp snooping
show ip dhcp snooping binding
show ip dhcp snooping statistics
```

### Example: corrected sample router configs (R1, R2, R3)

R1 (edge router with Fa0/0 in 192.168.1.0/24 and serial to R2):

```sh
enable
configure terminal
    hostname R1
    interface Fa0/0
        ip address 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown
    interface Se0/0/0
        ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown

    router rip
        version 2
        network 192.168.1.0
        network 192.168.2.0
    exit
exit
```

R2 (middle router between R1 and R3):

```sh
enable
configure terminal
    hostname R2
    interface Se0/0/0
        ip address 192.168.2.2 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown
    interface Se0/0/1
        ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown

    router rip
        version 2
        network 192.168.2.0
        network 192.168.3.0
    exit
exit
```

R3 (edge router with Fa0/0 in 192.168.4.0/24 and serial to R2):

```sh
enable
configure terminal
    hostname R3
    interface Fa0/0
        ip address 192.168.4.254 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown
    interface Se0/0/1
        ip address 192.168.3.2 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown

    router rip
        version 2
        network 192.168.3.0
        network 192.168.4.0
    exit
exit
```

These examples are cleaned up versions of the original snippets and include the corrected DHCP snooping guidance (trust only uplinks).

show spanning-tree vlan 10
```

```sh
configure terminal
    # Make this switch the root for VLAN X (primary)
    spanning-tree vlan <vlan_id> root primary
    # This subtracts 2 × 4096 from the default priority

    # Make this switch the secondary root for VLAN X
    spanning-tree vlan <vlan_id> root secondary
    # This subtracts 1 × 4096 from the default priority

    # Manually set the priority (must be a multiple of 4096, range 0-61440)
    spanning-tree vlan <vlan_id> priority <priority_value>
exit
```

> Note: it's 4096 because that step corresponds to the maximum number of VLANs (4096).

```sh
enable
configure terminal
    interface fa0/10
        # Enable PortFast on a specific interface (example fa0/10)
        spanning-tree portfast

        switchport port-security
        
        # Set the maximum number of MAC addresses allowed (default is 1)
        switchport port-security maximum <number>
        
        # Set the violation mode (shutdown is default)
        # shutdown: Disables the port. Must be manually re-enabled.
        # protect: Drops packets from unknown MACs, no log message.
        # restrict: Drops packets from unknown MACs, sends a log message and increments violation counter.
        switchport port-security violation <shutdown | protect | restrict>
        
        # Learn MAC addresses dynamically and add them to the running config
        switchport port-security mac-address sticky

sudo python3 -m http.server 80 # It will show the files on the pwd!
```

### Simple DNS server with dnsmasq

```conf
no-resolv
no-poll

listen-address=127.0.0.1

```

### Cisco Packet Tracer Servers

Notes on configuring services on a server in Cisco Packet Tracer.

#### DNS Server
1.  Go to the server's `Services` tab.
2.  Select `DNS`.
3.  Turn the service `On`.
4.  Create `A` records for your domains (e.g., `www.example.com`) pointing to your web server's IP.
5.  Create an `MX` record for your mail server (e.g., `mail.example.com`).

#### Email Server (SMTP/POP3)
1.  Go to the server's `Services` tab.
2.  Select `Email`.
3.  Turn `SMTP` and `POP3` services `On`.
4.  Set a domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
5.  Create user accounts with usernames and passwords.

#### Web Server (HTTP)
1.  Go to the server's `Services` tab.
2.  Select `HTTP`.
3.  Ensure `HTTP` and `HTTPS` are `On`.
4.  You can edit the `index.html` file to customize the web page.

#### FTP Server
1.  Go to the server's `Services` tab.
2.  Select `FTP`.
3.  Turn the service `On`.
4.  Create user accounts with specific permissions (Write, Read, Delete, Rename, List).

##### FTP Client Commands (from a PC's Command Prompt)
```sh
# Connect to the FTP server
ftp <server_ip>

# View files on the server
dir

# Upload a file to the server
put <filename>

# Download a file from the server
get <filename>

# Disconnect from the server
quit
```

## HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)

HSRP is a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default gateway.

### Basic Configuration

#### Example 1: Higher Priority Router (Active)

```sh
enable
configure terminal
    interface Fa0/0
        standby 10 ip 192.168.1.100 
        standby 10 priority 200
        standby 10 preempt
    exit
exit
```

#### Example 2: Lower Priority Router (Standby)

```sh
enable
configure terminal
    interface Fa0/0
        standby 10 ip 192.168.1.100 
        standby 10 priority 100
    exit
exit
```

### Verification

```sh
show standby
```
